PathPlan AI 🚀

Agentic Career Decision Intelligence System

PathPlan AI is a full-stack Agentic AI system that acts as a career co-pilot for students and early professionals.
Unlike traditional platforms that only provide recommendations, PathPlan AI reasons, debates, acts, learns from rejection, and adapts its strategy autonomously.

The system is designed to demonstrate agent autonomy, reasoning transparency, and feedback-driven learning in a single execution loop.

🧠 High-Level Architecture

PathPlan AI follows a backend-first, agent-centric architecture, where all intelligence resides in the backend and the frontend acts as a thin interaction layer.

🛠 Tech Stack

🧩 Backend

 -> Python – Core language for agent logic and orchestration

 -> FastAPI – High-performance API framework for agent execution

 -> Modular Agent Design – Each agent has a single, well-defined responsibility

In-Memory State (MVP) – Deterministic execution for demos and evaluation

🖥 Frontend

 -> TypeScript – Type-safe frontend development

 -> React – Lightweight UI for user input and output visualization

 -> JavaScript & CSS – UI behavior and styling

Thin UI Philosophy – No business logic in frontend

⚙️ Tooling & Platform

 -> Git & GitHub – Version control and collaboration

 -> Local Development First – No live APIs or external dependencies (MVP scope)

🧩 Key Design Principles

Agent Autonomy – Decisions are made by agents, not prompts

Reasoning Visibility – Debate and decision logic is exposed

Rejection-Driven Learning – Failure is treated as signal data

Ethical Realism ⚖️ – Prevents unsafe or unrealistic guidance

Backend-Dominant Intelligence – Frontend is purely supportive

🎯 Why PathPlan AI Stands Out

Demonstrates true agentic reasoning

Makes AI decisions explainable and auditable

Learns from rejection, not just success
